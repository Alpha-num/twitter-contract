# Twitter Smart Contract

This is a basic decentralized Twitter-like application built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to create, like, and unlike tweets, with all interactions stored on the blockchain. This project is implemented using Solidity, Foundry, and a React.js frontend.

## Features

- Users can create and view tweets
- Tweets can be liked and unliked by other users.
- All tweets and likes are recorded on the blockchain for transparency.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: For writing the smart contract.
- **Foundry**: For compiling, deploying, and testing the smart contract.
- **React.js**: For the frontend user interface.
- **Ethers.js**: For interacting with the smart contract from the frontend.
